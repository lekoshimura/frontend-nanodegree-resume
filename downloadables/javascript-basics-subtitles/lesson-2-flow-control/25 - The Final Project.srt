So this is your final project for the class.

0:00:07.130,0:00:10.180
And judging by the looks of it, your resume should be just about done.

0:00:10.180,0:00:11.350
Great job.

0:00:11.350,0:00:13.970
But, before we can let you off the hook,

0:00:13.970,0:00:16.450
remember that we've learned quite a bit about objects and

0:00:16.450,0:00:20.280
the way that they can encapsulate information and related functions.

0:00:20.280,0:00:22.790
This is a two-part final project.

0:00:22.790,0:00:25.930
In the first part, take the display functions that you wrote and

0:00:25.930,0:00:31.780
encapsulate them within their respective display, work and education objects.

0:00:31.780,0:00:34.970
>> The second part of this project is to make the page your own.

0:00:35.970,0:00:39.950
You can add whatever you want to show how truly awesome you are.

0:00:39.950,0:00:42.900
In the Instructor's Notes, we've added links to a couple of

0:00:42.900,0:00:47.120
cool JavaScript libraries to do interactive graphics and charts.

0:00:47.120,0:00:48.040
>> Right.

0:00:48.040,0:00:51.140
There are thousands of awesome JavaScript libraries out there, and

0:00:51.140,0:00:53.700
most of them are really simple to include in your project.

0:00:53.700,0:00:54.633
Go the extra mile, and

0:00:54.633,0:00:57.690
make your project really stand out by taking advantage of any one of them.

0:00:57.690,0:00:58.327
Good luck.
