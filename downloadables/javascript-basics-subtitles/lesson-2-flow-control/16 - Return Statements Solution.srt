0:00:00.660,0:00:04.500
Okay, starting off we've got this work object that's got all of my jobs in it.

0:00:04.500,0:00:05.160
Very cool.

0:00:07.020,0:00:10.710
Then we come down to the bottom here and we find the locationizer function.

0:00:10.710,0:00:13.890
Locationizer's taking in the work_obj from above and

0:00:13.890,0:00:14.780
let's take a look inside of it.

0:00:15.970,0:00:17.760
We start off by initializing a new array,

0:00:17.760,0:00:20.760
which in this case is called locationArray and it starts off empty.

0:00:22.090,0:00:23.130
And then we've got a for n loop.

0:00:24.260,0:00:29.360
This for n loop is going to iterate over every job within work object dot jobs.

0:00:29.360,0:00:32.210
So remember, work object is the object that we have up here,

0:00:32.210,0:00:36.080
it's being passed in, and we're going to iterate through all of the jobs in it.

0:00:36.080,0:00:38.590
For each of the new jobs, we're going to create a variable and

0:00:38.590,0:00:41.310
don't worry, it's going to get overwritten every time we run through this loop.

0:00:42.600,0:00:44.660
The variable is called new location.

0:00:44.660,0:00:48.710
And we're going to set it equal to the location of each job.

0:00:49.980,0:00:51.690
So let's break this down a little bit.

0:00:51.690,0:00:54.340
We've got the work object, and then within the work object,

0:00:54.340,0:00:56.130
we've got the jobs array.

0:00:56.130,0:00:57.970
And now because of the for in loop,

0:00:57.970,0:01:02.940
we've got the index of each job within the jobs array within the work object.

0:01:02.940,0:01:05.349
And then for each job we want the location.

0:01:05.349,0:01:08.120
So we're just going to use .notation to get the location.

0:01:08.120,0:01:11.744
Once we have each location we're going to push them using the .push

0:01:11.744,0:01:13.060
array method.

0:01:13.060,0:01:16.190
So we'll start off with the name of the array that we want to return later and

0:01:16.190,0:01:20.090
we'll do .push with a location as the parameter.

0:01:20.090,0:01:23.350
Once this for loop is finished we're going to return the location array which we

0:01:23.350,0:01:24.030
created earlier.

0:01:25.180,0:01:26.680
All right, let's go ahead and see if this works.

0:01:26.680,0:01:27.730
All right, we'll come down here.

0:01:27.730,0:01:34.350
And let's console.log locationizer.

0:01:34.350,0:01:36.810
And we'll pass in the work object from above.

0:01:37.900,0:01:41.820
And if all goes well, we should see an array of locations where I worked.

0:01:41.820,0:01:43.520
We'll hit test run.

0:01:43.520,0:01:44.120
Scroll down.

0:01:45.150,0:01:48.350
And there we go. The log says that I've worked Mountain View, Seattle.

0:01:48.350,0:01:49.700
And I've had two jobs in Nashville.
