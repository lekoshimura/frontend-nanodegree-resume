Now that our code is inside a function,

0:00:02.680,0:00:05.720
it has to be called, otherwise it won't work.

0:00:05.720,0:00:09.040
So let's invoke our code right after we define it.

0:00:09.040,0:00:13.210
Now first I'm going to give myself a little bit more space here so

0:00:13.210,0:00:19.700
you can see what I'm writing, and if we call display work and save it and

0:00:19.700,0:00:24.920
refresh the page, we can see that our work experience appears right here.

0:00:24.920,0:00:29.310
>> Hm, so, James, when you wrote display work, you didn't put an argument in,

0:00:29.310,0:00:30.790
you didn't pass in a parameter.

0:00:30.790,0:00:33.060
That's pretty interesting, why didn't we have to use one?

0:00:33.060,0:00:37.060
>> Well, this function is using an object that's in the global scope for

0:00:37.060,0:00:40.880
the script, meaning it's accessible to the function which is also in

0:00:40.880,0:00:41.960
the global scope.

0:00:41.960,0:00:43.900
>> True, but let's imagine that we wanted to,

0:00:43.900,0:00:47.930
I don't know, for some reason, add multiple different work sessions to the page.

0:00:47.930,0:00:49.780
Then, what would be need to do?

0:00:49.780,0:00:51.860
>> That sounds like a job for an argument.

0:00:51.860,0:00:56.020
If this function took in an argument, we could pass it different work objects,

0:00:56.020,0:00:58.170
which would each get displayed on the page.

0:00:58.170,0:01:00.060
>> You think we should do that?

0:01:00.060,0:01:03.960
>> I'm having a hard time imagining, why you want to do that for this example.

0:01:03.960,0:01:05.180
I have a better idea.

0:01:05.180,0:01:08.680
Lets say you wanted to track where users are clicking on your site.

0:01:08.680,0:01:12.820
We could collect the cursor location every time a user clicks on the page and

0:01:12.820,0:01:15.100
send that off to our analytics site.

0:01:15.100,0:01:16.729
>> Interesting, let's see how that works.
