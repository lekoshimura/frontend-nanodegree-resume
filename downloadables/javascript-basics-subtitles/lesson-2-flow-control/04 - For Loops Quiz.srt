For loops are similar to while loops but check for

0:00:03.450,0:00:06.050
conditions in a slightly different way.

0:00:06.050,0:00:08.310
We have an initialization value,

0:00:08.310,0:00:12.620
a condition that gets checked on every iteration of the loop, and

0:00:12.620,0:00:17.980
a mutator that increments or decrements the initialization value.

0:00:17.980,0:00:22.920
>> So for example, in this for loop, we initialize an incrementor i

0:00:22.920,0:00:26.530
by using the same var syntax we've been using all course.

0:00:26.530,0:00:31.310
Then we set the condition i less than nine using an operator that we saw before,

0:00:31.310,0:00:35.720
and then we increment i by one by adding i plus plus.

0:00:35.720,0:00:39.010
For every trip through the loop, we're going to console.log(i).

You know what?

0:00:40.460,0:00:41.980
Before I tell you what's going to happen,

0:00:41.980,0:00:43.600
I think this is something you can figure out on your own.

0:00:44.840,0:00:46.330
Make a prediction.

0:00:46.330,0:00:47.640
What will the result of this code be?

0:00:47.640,0:00:49.440
Type your answer in this box.

0:00:49.440,0:00:54.130
Once you've made your prediction, type this code into your browser's console and

0:00:54.130,0:00:56.400
press Enter to watch what happens.

0:00:56.400,0:00:57.270
Is it what you expected?

0:00:58.550,0:00:59.740
When you try to type this for

0:00:59.740,0:01:03.580
loop into your browser, don't worry about putting everything on separate lines.

0:01:03.580,0:01:05.410
You can type all this out on one line.
