0:00:00.180,0:00:05.020
So first, we check to see if our list of skills has a length that's greater

0:00:05.020,0:00:06.020
than 0.

0:00:06.020,0:00:11.660
If it does, we start by appending our HTMLskillsStart.

0:00:11.660,0:00:15.050
We can see here that we have a formatted skill,

0:00:15.050,0:00:20.480
which is created by taking HTMLskills and calling the .replace method,

0:00:20.480,0:00:26.530
and replacing the data place holder with the first in the list of skills.

0:00:26.530,0:00:28.510
Lastly, we append that skill to the page.

0:00:29.770,0:00:31.880
And for the remaining three items,

0:00:31.880,0:00:35.660
we repeat that same code, only changing the index.
