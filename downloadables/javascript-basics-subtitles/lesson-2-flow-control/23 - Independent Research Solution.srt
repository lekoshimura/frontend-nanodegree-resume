So, taking a look at this snippet of code,

0:00:02.180,0:00:06.030
it looks like $(document).click() is taking in some kind of function.

0:00:06.030,0:00:08.260
We see function, then a parameter, and

0:00:08.260,0:00:11.590
then these curly braces that are passing in, well, some instructions.

0:00:11.590,0:00:13.800
This is similar to regular function syntax,

0:00:13.800,0:00:17.610
where we declare a function with the keyword function, set some parameters, and

0:00:17.610,0:00:19.320
then put code inside curly braces.

0:00:19.320,0:00:20.930
But this function doesn't seem to have a name.

0:00:20.930,0:00:22.600
And that's kind of curious.

0:00:22.600,0:00:24.200
So let's go ahead and open up Google.

0:00:24.200,0:00:27.450
I typed in JavaScript function without name and

0:00:27.450,0:00:29.480
I'm going to take a look at the results.

0:00:29.480,0:00:32.950
We came across an article about JavaScript Anonymous Functions.

0:00:32.950,0:00:34.190
This seems really useful.

0:00:34.190,0:00:37.520
It looks like an anonymous function is one that's declared without a name.

0:00:37.520,0:00:38.870
That sounds like what we've got.

0:00:38.870,0:00:43.160
So it looks like $(document).click is taking an anonymous function as

0:00:43.160,0:00:43.750
a parameter.

0:00:43.750,0:00:46.840
You'll find anonymous functions all over the place in JavaScript.

0:00:46.840,0:00:49.990
So I encourage you to check out the resources in the Instructor Notes to learn

0:00:49.990,0:00:50.550
more about them.
