Hey James, what do you say about treating a displayProjects function that will

0:00:09.568,0:00:12.500
handle all of our projects and display them on a page?

0:00:12.500,0:00:14.330
>> I have a better idea.

0:00:14.330,0:00:17.440
We only just touch the surface of what objects can do.

0:00:17.440,0:00:19.170
Let's take a look at them first, and

0:00:19.170,0:00:23.110
then we'll finish off our resume using our newfound knowledge of objects.

0:00:23.110,0:00:23.820
Does that work for you?

0:00:23.820,0:00:24.410
>> Yeah.

0:00:24.410,0:00:26.060
Why don't you start us off?

0:00:26.060,0:00:30.250
>> We saw earlier that we define objects with these curly braces.

0:00:30.250,0:00:34.080
And we also include code for functions inside the curly braces.

0:00:34.080,0:00:34.810
Guess what?

0:00:34.810,0:00:36.140
Functions are objects.

0:00:36.140,0:00:36.680
>> What?

0:00:36.680,0:00:38.250
>> I know you knew that already.

0:00:38.250,0:00:43.160
It's a little bit crazy, but pretty much everything in JavaScript is really

0:00:43.160,0:00:45.180
an object when you get right down to it.

0:00:45.180,0:00:48.300
There's a link in the instructor's notes with implications from

0:00:48.300,0:00:50.850
the relationship between functions and object.

0:00:50.850,0:00:54.190
For our purposes it's useful to note that objects can

0:00:54.190,0:00:56.310
encapsulate functions as well.

0:00:56.310,0:00:56.850
>> Yeah.

0:00:56.850,0:01:01.190
For instance, let's create display as a method of the projects object.

0:01:01.190,0:01:02.860
Projects, the object,

0:01:02.860,0:01:06.120
already includes all of our data about all of the projects we've completed.

0:01:06.120,0:01:09.400
And now it's going to include a function that will help us display

0:01:09.400,0:01:10.680
those projects.

0:01:10.680,0:01:12.340
Using dot notation here,

0:01:12.340,0:01:15.590
we can add a new property to the projects object called display.

0:01:15.590,0:01:17.910
And we'll set it equal to a function.

0:01:17.910,0:01:21.730
Within these curly braces, we'll define what the function display will do.

0:01:21.730,0:01:26.370
Even though we defined the projects object with object literal notation,

0:01:26.370,0:01:28.860
it doesn't matter how we defined the projects object,

0:01:28.860,0:01:32.350
we can still crreate this property display using dot notation.

0:01:32.350,0:01:33.990
This is called encapsulation,

0:01:33.990,0:01:38.440
meaning that we're holding the display function inside the projects object.

0:01:38.440,0:01:41.370
It's a nice way to organize our code into logical domains and

0:01:41.370,0:01:43.680
JavaScript makes it really easy to do so.

0:01:43.680,0:01:44.280
>> Nice.

0:01:44.280,0:01:46.830
So what should go inside projects.display?

0:01:46.830,0:01:47.750
>> Hm, you know what?

0:01:47.750,0:01:49.220
Let's let the students decide first.
