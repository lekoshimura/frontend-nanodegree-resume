Alright.

0:00:00.760,0:00:03.500
It took a little bit of time, but this is what I came up with.

0:00:03.500,0:00:06.620
This is the same code that we had before and really the only new

0:00:06.620,0:00:11.410
parts here are iterating through the dates and the descriptions for each job.

0:00:11.410,0:00:13.820
Here, I'm doing the same thing we did before.

0:00:13.820,0:00:17.020
I'm replacing some data from the HTML work

0:00:17.020,0:00:20.700
dates string with the dates from my work object and

0:00:20.700,0:00:25.110
then I'm appending the formatted dates to the last element of class work entry.

0:00:25.110,0:00:26.550
Same thing with description.

0:00:26.550,0:00:30.550
I'm replacing the placeholder data with work.jobs(job).description, and

0:00:30.550,0:00:35.610
then appending the formatted version to the last element of class work-entry.

0:00:35.610,0:00:36.829
And this is what we see on the page.
