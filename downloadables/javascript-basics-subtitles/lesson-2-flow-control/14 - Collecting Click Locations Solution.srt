Okay, so here's the shell of the code that we saw before, where we're

0:00:04.460,0:00:08.790
grabbing the click location on the document, which is just the whole website.

0:00:08.790,0:00:12.900
And we're going to be running some steps, using this weird function syntax,

0:00:12.900,0:00:15.190
that we'll actually be learning a little bit more about soon.

0:00:15.190,0:00:19.430
Every time the page is clicked, we create two new variables, x and y.

0:00:19.430,0:00:21.720
Both of them use this location object,

0:00:21.720,0:00:25.910
this location event object from the click, and we grab its pageX and its pageY,

0:00:25.910,0:00:30.340
which are simply the pixel values of the x and y location of the clicks.

0:00:30.340,0:00:34.720
Once we have the x and y locations, we simply pass them into logClicks and

0:00:34.720,0:00:39.750
we should see, when we click, there it is again, x and y locations.
