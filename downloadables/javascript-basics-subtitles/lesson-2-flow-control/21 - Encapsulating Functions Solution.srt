All right, so, this is what I came up with.

0:00:02.719,0:00:07.150
First and foremost, we need to set this display method on the projects object.

0:00:07.150,0:00:11.030
So, using dot notation, I simply set the property display on

0:00:11.030,0:00:13.990
the project's object and set it equal to a function.

0:00:13.990,0:00:19.220
This function is using a for in loop, for projects in projects.projects.

0:00:19.220,0:00:20.640
Inside the projects object,

0:00:20.640,0:00:24.180
we have an array of projects, also called, well, projects.

0:00:24.180,0:00:25.020
Like we said in the hint,

0:00:25.020,0:00:29.020
we need to start with HTMLprojectStart to create a new project entry.

0:00:29.020,0:00:31.940
Then you'll see a set of steps where we're appending the title.

0:00:31.940,0:00:37.282
The dates, the description, and images to this project entry last element.

0:00:37.282,0:00:42.220
Remember, HTMLprojectStart is creating an element with the class project entry,

0:00:42.220,0:00:45.420
and we want to grab the last one every time we work through this list.

0:00:45.420,0:00:48.120
Following the same strategies we've been using in this class,

0:00:48.120,0:00:52.210
we'll be appending each of these elements to project-entry:last, and

0:00:52.210,0:00:55.090
when we're done, we should see a nice beautiful project section.
