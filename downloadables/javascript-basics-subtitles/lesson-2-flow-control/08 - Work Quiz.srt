All right.

0:00:01.720,0:00:04.880

0:00:04.880,0:00:08.400
let's make some concerted effort to complete the work session,

0:00:08.400,0:00:12.620
the required information for which you will find in the instructor's notes.

0:00:12.620,0:00:14.850
You've already made your work object.

0:00:14.850,0:00:17.670
Using any of the control flow patterns you've learned so

0:00:17.670,0:00:20.560

0:00:20.560,0:00:24.830
format the HTML with the proper templates, and append it to the page.

0:00:24.830,0:00:27.080
