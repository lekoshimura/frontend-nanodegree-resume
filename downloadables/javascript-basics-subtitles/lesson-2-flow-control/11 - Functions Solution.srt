Okay. So I've created my display work function.

0:00:03.469,0:00:07.200

0:00:08.240,0:00:12.140
hit refresh, we can see that my work section actually has disappeared.

0:00:12.140,0:00:14.940

0:00:14.940,0:00:16.550
I are cheating and we already have the answers in.

0:00:16.550,0:00:20.760

Let's investigate how to invoke functions.
