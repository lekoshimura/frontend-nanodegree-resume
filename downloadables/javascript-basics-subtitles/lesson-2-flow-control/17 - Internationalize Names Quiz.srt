Fun fact.

0:00:01.230,0:00:02.580
James, did you know that,

0:00:02.580,0:00:05.689
in many parts of the world, names are capitalized differently?

0:00:05.689,0:00:09.130
While Americans capitalize the first letter of both names,

0:00:09.130,0:00:13.190
in many places of the world, the first name has the first letter capitalized,

0:00:13.190,0:00:15.520
while the last name is entirely capitalized.

0:00:15.520,0:00:16.100
>> Really?

0:00:16.100,0:00:18.050
I guess that does make sense.

0:00:18.050,0:00:20.920
In some countries, I know that they list the family name first and

0:00:20.920,0:00:23.790
the first name second, and it probably makes sense if

0:00:23.790,0:00:26.980
our resumes could switch to international mode to do the same.

0:00:26.980,0:00:29.470
>> Yeah, this sounds like an interesting challenge.

0:00:29.470,0:00:32.409
First off, append the internationalized button to the main div.

0:00:32.409,0:00:36.010
This is just a string with HTML that will create a button.

0:00:36.010,0:00:41.020
Then, create a function named inName() that takes a string of two names and

0:00:41.020,0:00:44.720
returns an internationalized version that would look something like this.

0:00:44.720,0:00:46.500
When you're done, check this button.

0:00:46.500,0:00:49.240
You should be able to see the new internationalized name show up on

0:00:49.240,0:00:51.120
the resume every time you click the button.
