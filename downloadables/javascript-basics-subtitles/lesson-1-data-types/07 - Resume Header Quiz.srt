For this quiz, you're going to be putting your name and

0:00:02.250,0:00:07.520
your role to the top of your resume using the same technique James just used.

0:00:07.520,0:00:10.850
You'll start by replacing %data% and

0:00:10.850,0:00:16.710
HTML header name and HTML header role with your name and your role.

0:00:16.710,0:00:19.790
In this case, the role is the type of job your looking for.

0:00:19.790,0:00:21.590
So for me, I would have Web Developer.

0:00:22.670,0:00:27.810
You can find the strings HTMLheaderName and HTMLheaderRole within helper JS.

0:00:29.380,0:00:33.847
Once you're done, you will either append or prepend the formatted name and

0:00:33.847,0:00:36.650
formatted role to the page header.

0:00:36.650,0:00:39.915
Now, append adds something to the end of HTML.

0:00:39.915,0:00:42.690
While prepend adds something to the beginning of HTML.

0:00:42.690,0:00:46.000
For this quiz, you might need to experiment with append and

0:00:46.000,0:00:48.630
prepend to get a feel for both of them.

0:00:48.630,0:00:53.220
Once you see your name in roll appear on the page correctly, check this box.

0:00:53.220,0:00:55.920
And when you do it right, your resume should look something like this.
