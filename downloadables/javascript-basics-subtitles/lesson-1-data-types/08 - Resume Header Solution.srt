0:00:00.160,0:00:01.950
And here's the code that we use to do that.

0:00:03.560,0:00:06.445
Now, you might remember form edit name from before.

0:00:06.445,0:00:08.427
And we added form edit role.

0:00:08.427,0:00:15.061
Now, to create our form edit role, we took html header role.replace,

0:00:15.061,0:00:21.940
and we replaced the data placeholder with the role that we created up here.

0:00:23.460,0:00:26.400
So, this next bit of code is a little bit tricky.

0:00:26.400,0:00:29.740
So, over here we have our header div.

0:00:29.740,0:00:33.950
We can see that header already has an unorder list inside of it.

0:00:33.950,0:00:37.600
So, if we pin the data, it would actually put the data right here.

0:00:38.690,0:00:43.580
We want it to show at the beginning of our header tag, right here.

0:00:45.010,0:00:47.760
In order to add elements to the beginning,

0:00:47.760,0:00:51.350
we actually need to use prepend instead of append.

0:00:52.580,0:00:56.240
So, we want our name to appear first and our role to appear second.

0:00:57.980,0:01:03.060
So running through this code, when we append our form edit role,

0:01:03.060,0:01:04.739
it'll show up at the top here.

0:01:07.930,0:01:12.000
And then when we prepend our name, instead of showing it

0:01:12.000,0:01:17.290
at the end as append would, it will insert it in the beginning.
