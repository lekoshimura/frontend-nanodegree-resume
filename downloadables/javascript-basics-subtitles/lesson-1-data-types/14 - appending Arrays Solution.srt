0:00:00.220,0:00:01.060
To find this out,

0:00:01.060,0:00:05.880
we'll take a look at a appending skills.length to the main div on the page.

0:00:05.880,0:00:10.160
Looking at the array, we have index zero, index one, index two, and index three.

0:00:10.160,0:00:14.210
So, let's go ahead and save this.

0:00:14.210,0:00:16.710
Come over to the browser and hit refresh.

0:00:16.710,0:00:19.410
And we can see that the skills length is four,

0:00:19.410,0:00:24.270
despite the fact that the last item in the array has an index of three.

0:00:24.270,0:00:28.770
So, looking at the question, is the length of an array equal to the last index?

0:00:28.770,0:00:30.230
The correct answer is no.
