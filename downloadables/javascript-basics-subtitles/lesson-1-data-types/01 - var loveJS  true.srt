>> James, you know,

0:00:06.161,0:00:10.200
I really like how we're getting immediate visual results from our code.

0:00:10.200,0:00:12.250
>> JavaScript's fun like that.

0:00:12.250,0:00:14.080
It runs natively in the browser.

0:00:14.080,0:00:17.080
And it allows us to run an inspector code very easily.

0:00:17.080,0:00:20.050
That's something you should be doing when you're starting out as a developer.

0:00:20.050,0:00:20.879
>> Yeah, it really is.

0:00:21.900,0:00:23.850
By the way, why are we in your GitHub again?

0:00:23.850,0:00:25.920
>> Because this is where I store my code and

0:00:25.920,0:00:29.660
I wanted to get the students thinking about what it means to save their data.

0:00:31.440,0:00:33.080
>> Like other programming languages,

0:00:33.080,0:00:36.850
JavaScript gives us a way of saving data in the form of variables.

0:00:36.850,0:00:39.230
The syntax looks like this.

0:00:39.230,0:00:43.980
Var, variable name equals some valuable.

0:00:43.980,0:00:46.760
To declare a new variable you begin with the keyword var,

0:00:47.840,0:00:49.690
regardless of the data type your saving.

0:00:51.110,0:00:52.320
In the example here,

0:00:53.680,0:00:59.800
we're creating a variable called firstName in assigning it the string james.

0:00:59.800,0:01:02.260
The string comes in closing quotes.

0:01:02.260,0:01:05.730
Notice that saving variables is slightly different than Python,

0:01:05.730,0:01:08.800
which doesn't require a key word like var.

0:01:08.800,0:01:11.310
But otherwise, works the same.

0:01:11.310,0:01:12.220
>> Good point.

0:01:12.220,0:01:16.288
But otherwise, saving variables in Python and JavaScript are pretty similar.

0:01:16.288,0:01:19.010
Numbers in JavaScript don't need quotes and there's no need to

0:01:19.010,0:01:21.910
worry about any of the nuances between floating point numbers and

0:01:21.910,0:01:26.340
integers, because all numbers are saved 64 bit floating point.

0:01:26.340,0:01:29.600
>> Later on we'll see that arrays, functions and

0:01:29.600,0:01:33.580
even objects use the same var syntax.

0:01:34.600,0:01:37.350
Let us see if our variables were actually saved.

0:01:37.350,0:01:41.750
I'm going to add console.log(firstName).

0:01:41.750,0:01:45.280
Save this file and reload the website.

0:01:45.280,0:01:48.200
Opening up the console to see if it shows up.

0:01:48.200,0:01:49.370
>> And there it is.

0:01:49.370,0:01:50.850
I like that strategy.

0:01:50.850,0:01:53.750
The browser opens up a script with console.log in it.

0:01:53.750,0:01:57.520
It'll print whatever information it receives to the browser console.

0:01:57.520,0:01:58.240
>> Yep.

0:01:58.240,0:01:59.920
It's a useful trick for debugging code.
