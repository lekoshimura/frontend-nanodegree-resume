0:00:00.330,0:00:03.490
We're just learing about truthy and falsey values.

0:00:03.490,0:00:06.060
Let's apply that to what we know about arrays.

0:00:06.060,0:00:09.520
Is the length of an array equal to the last index?

0:00:09.520,0:00:11.340
Mark yes or no here.

0:00:11.340,0:00:13.560
>> And, to find the length of an array,

0:00:13.560,0:00:16.660
simply add .length to the end of the array name
