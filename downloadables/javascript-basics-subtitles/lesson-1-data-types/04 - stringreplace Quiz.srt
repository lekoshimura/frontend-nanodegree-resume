As we said before, we'll be using template HTML to build our awesome resumes.

0:00:04.939,0:00:10.440
>> To do so, we'll be using the string.replace method to find a pattern

0:00:10.440,0:00:14.380
in a string and replace all or some matches of it.

0:00:14.380,0:00:18.940
We'll be using the most simple version to find the first instance of a pattern,

0:00:18.940,0:00:20.270
but you can do much more.

0:00:20.270,0:00:22.790
Check the instructor's notes for more details.

0:00:22.790,0:00:25.360
>> Let's take my email address as an example.

0:00:26.490,0:00:31.040
If I wanted to change out my Udacity email address for

0:00:31.040,0:00:34.040
a Gmail email address, I could use a replace function.

0:00:36.240,0:00:39.540
In this case, I've got var newEmail.

0:00:39.540,0:00:43.310
It goes email, the string with my Udacity email address and

0:00:43.310,0:00:45.940
I'm replacing Udacity with Gmail.

0:00:47.020,0:00:49.810
>> And don't forget to check to see if that worked.

0:00:49.810,0:00:50.680
>> Right.

0:00:50.680,0:00:57.668
Let me add console.log email to see my old email address and

0:00:57.668,0:01:03.940
console.log(newEmail) to see my new email address.

0:01:04.959,0:01:11.730
Okay, we're going to refresh our page, open up the console and there we go.

0:01:11.730,0:01:15.510
We can see my old udacity email address showing up on the console as well

0:01:15.510,0:01:18.280
as my new Gmail address on the console as well.

0:01:19.630,0:01:21.440
>> Let's have the students try it but

0:01:21.440,0:01:23.780
this time, let's append the new message to the page.

0:01:23.780,0:01:29.210
I want you to create a new called funThoughts where you take

0:01:29.210,0:01:34.800
everything that was in awesomeThoughts, but replace the word awesome with fun.

0:01:34.800,0:01:39.410
Use .append(funThoughts) and put it on the page.

0:01:39.410,0:01:41.910
Check this box when you see your message show up on the page.
