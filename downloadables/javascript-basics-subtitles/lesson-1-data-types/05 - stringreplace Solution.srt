So I've got my string awesomeThoughts and

0:00:03.040,0:00:06.560
it's saved as My name is Cameron and I am AWESOME!

0:00:07.740,0:00:11.410
I'm going to create a new variable called funThoughs and I'm going to use

0:00:11.410,0:00:17.170
the replace method to replace the word AWESOME from awesomeThoughts, with FUN.

0:00:17.170,0:00:20.667
Once I've done that, I'm going to use the jQuery selector here for

0:00:20.667,0:00:24.620
the main id and I'll append our new funThoughts variable.

0:00:24.620,0:00:26.520
Save that, come over to the browser and

0:00:26.520,0:00:30.930
hit Refresh, and we see that my name is Cameron and I am FUN
