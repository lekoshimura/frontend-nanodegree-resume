Okay.

0:00:00.990,0:00:02.570
Here's the object I came up with.

0:00:03.735,0:00:07.330
We can see that restoring name, role and contacts, as well as,

0:00:07.330,0:00:11.250
welcome message and skills as the keys in this object.

0:00:12.470,0:00:16.980
John Doe is the value for name, web developer is the value for role.

0:00:16.980,0:00:20.180
Notice how there are commas after every value.

0:00:20.180,0:00:22.650
Inside context, we're storing an object.

0:00:22.650,0:00:26.020
We know it's an object because we see the curly braces here and here.

0:00:27.530,0:00:30.410
Inside this object, we have a few more keys and

0:00:30.410,0:00:32.759
a few more values for contact information.

0:00:34.070,0:00:37.210
After the object, we have a comma then we have our welcome message.

0:00:38.360,0:00:40.770
And then array for our skills.

0:00:40.770,0:00:45.130
Inside the array, noted by these square brackets, we see four skills.

0:00:45.130,0:00:49.980
Then we finish up with bioPic, which is a link to a URL with our image.

0:00:49.980,0:00:52.380
Notice that after this last value, we don't have a coma,

0:00:52.380,0:00:55.210
and then we finish up the object with another curly brace.
