0:00:09.900,0:00:11.830
So, where are we now?

0:00:11.830,0:00:13.130
>> We're in a sauna, and

0:00:13.130,0:00:16.360
this list over here is everything that I wanted to cover in this course.

0:00:16.360,0:00:17.280
>> Okay.

0:00:17.280,0:00:20.980
>> Yeah, okay, so arrays in JavaScript are just like lists.

0:00:20.980,0:00:25.610
In this case, the zero item is Intro, after that, we have GitHub and so on.

0:00:25.610,0:00:30.170
I'm really glad you said zeroing because JavaScript arrays are zero index.

0:00:30.170,0:00:31.520
>> Yeah, they sure are.

0:00:31.520,0:00:32.020
Let's take a look.

0:00:33.691,0:00:37.930
Arrays are just lists of values and they behave the same as lists in Python.

0:00:37.930,0:00:41.200
We start lists with the same syntax as before, with var and

0:00:41.200,0:00:43.980
then the name of the array, followed by an equals sign.

0:00:43.980,0:00:47.960
The array will be defined by these square brackets with items inside,

0:00:47.960,0:00:49.060
separated by commas.

0:00:50.150,0:00:55.030
Let's make an array of skills, this could be really useful on our resumes later.

0:00:55.030,0:00:59.580
So I'll go ahead and start with var skills and then I'll start with awesomeness.

0:00:59.580,0:01:01.200
>> That's not a skill, dude.

0:01:01.200,0:01:03.550
>> It actually is if you check my LinkedIn profile.

0:01:03.550,0:01:08.880
Then I've got programming, teaching and JavaScript, all separated by commas.

0:01:08.880,0:01:12.700
I'll go ahead and append the skills to the page, save it,

0:01:13.740,0:01:18.270
come over here, hit Refresh and we can see it on the page.

0:01:18.270,0:01:21.470
It's not separated by any commas or spaces here, because we

0:01:21.470,0:01:25.420
didn't have any commas or spaces within the strings, in our skills array.

0:01:25.420,0:01:26.570
And we can see that we have now,

0:01:26.570,0:01:29.950
just awesomeness added to the end, of our array.

0:01:31.200,0:01:33.680
Let's say I just wanted to append the first item,

0:01:33.680,0:01:35.980
awesomeness, to the page instead.

0:01:35.980,0:01:40.260
I'll start by commenting out this line, and then using bracket notation

0:01:40.260,0:01:44.790
I'll append the zeroth item of the skills array to the main div on the page.

0:01:44.790,0:01:47.330
I'll go ahead and save this, come over to the browser and

0:01:47.330,0:01:50.740
hit Refresh, and we can see that we just have awesomeness on

0:01:50.740,0:01:53.860
the page now because we used bracket notation.

0:01:53.860,0:01:57.390
>> Nice, one cool thing is that JavaScript gives us a way of

0:01:57.390,0:01:59.320
accessing properties about the array.

0:02:00.490,0:02:03.360
In fact, you should give it a try, let's take a quiz.
