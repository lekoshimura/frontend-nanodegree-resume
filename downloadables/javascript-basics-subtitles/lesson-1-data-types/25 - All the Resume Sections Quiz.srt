So James, do you think we should go over the differences between

0:00:03.130,0:00:07.300
bracket notation, dot notation and object literal notation?

0:00:07.300,0:00:07.870
>> Not really.

0:00:07.870,0:00:11.130
I think that conversation would make this class a lot longer.

0:00:11.130,0:00:14.690
Let's put a link in the instructor's notes to give students more information.

0:00:14.690,0:00:17.100
Good news is, they're pretty similar.

0:00:17.100,0:00:17.930
>> Yeah. That's fair.

0:00:19.000,0:00:22.860
Okay. So we're about to get into control flow in JavaScript.

0:00:22.860,0:00:25.910
But, before we do, let's go ahead and finish all of our objects.

0:00:25.910,0:00:29.440
The work object and projects objects needed to be created.

0:00:29.440,0:00:32.980
And let's go ahead and finish up the biography and education objects.

0:00:34.620,0:00:35.750
While we're at it, let's go ahead and

0:00:35.750,0:00:41.790
clean out resumeBuilder.js too, so that way, it only contains the four objects.

0:00:41.790,0:00:45.380
You might have some code in resumeBuilder.js from previous quizzes.

0:00:45.380,0:00:47.670
If you want to keep it, that's totally cool.

0:00:47.670,0:00:50.250
But you should comment it out with two slashes.

0:00:50.250,0:00:51.160
These two slashes at

0:00:51.160,0:00:54.510
the beginning of any line will comment out the rest of the line.

0:00:54.510,0:00:58.010
Or, if you don't want to comment out your code, you can just simply cut and

0:00:58.010,0:01:00.350
paste all of it into a different file.

0:01:00.350,0:01:01.650
>> That's a good idea.

0:01:01.650,0:01:04.530
Let's start the next lesson with a clean file,

0:01:04.530,0:01:06.940
with just our biographical objects.

0:01:06.940,0:01:10.840
Click this box once you've created your bio, work, projects and

0:01:10.840,0:01:12.380
education objects, and

0:01:12.380,0:01:16.330
either have cleared out or commented out, all of your previous code.
