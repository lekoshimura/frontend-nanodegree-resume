As we know, HTML defines the content of a page.

0:00:04.030,0:00:05.930
Now that we know how to replace text,

0:00:05.930,0:00:09.600
we can replace placeholders in HTML with real data.

0:00:09.600,0:00:14.630
After that, we just need to append HTML strings to start building our resume.

0:00:14.630,0:00:18.410
>> Let's look inside helper.js, which through the magic of computers we

0:00:18.410,0:00:21.080
have over here on this side of the screen.

0:00:21.080,0:00:25.230
It contains some helper data that your project will take advantage of.

0:00:25.230,0:00:30.680
Because helper.js shows up before resumebuilder.js, which you can't see,

0:00:30.680,0:00:32.759
but it's way down here at the bottom of the screen.

0:00:32.759,0:00:38.170
It will load first, and we'll have access to all the data from helper.js,

0:00:38.170,0:00:41.160
when we start writing resumebuilder.js.

0:00:41.160,0:00:43.404
We can see a few string variables here,

0:00:43.404,0:00:49.270
Ike HTML mobile, HTML email and HTML twitter.

0:00:49.270,0:00:52.928
Each of them has a percent, data percent place holder.

0:00:52.928,0:00:54.077
Here and here.

0:00:54.077,0:01:00.480
And each of those will be replacing %data% with our actual data.

0:01:01.590,0:01:04.870
>> So how are they going to replace %data%?

0:01:04.870,0:01:08.670
>> The same way we replaced awesome with fun, using the replace method.

0:01:10.000,0:01:11.080
>> Let's see it.

0:01:11.080,0:01:16.140
>> Let's say I wanted my properly formatted name to appear on the page.

0:01:16.140,0:01:17.050
In that case,

0:01:17.050,0:01:21.310
I first need to create a new variable that stores HTML with my data.

0:01:22.310,0:01:26.698
I'll save a variable called formattedName and set it equal to

0:01:26.698,0:01:33.558
HTMLheaderName.replace, %data%,

0:01:33.558,0:01:36.180
and pass in a variable storing my name.

0:01:37.640,0:01:40.860
Then I will pin the formattedName to the header.

0:01:42.230,0:01:43.180
Voila.

0:01:43.180,0:01:44.290
There's my formatted name.

0:01:45.480,0:01:45.980
>> Very cool.
