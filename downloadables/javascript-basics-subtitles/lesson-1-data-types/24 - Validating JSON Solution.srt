I've gone ahead and diagrammed what we're seeing in the JSon over here.

0:00:04.970,0:00:08.930
We have an education object, which we see right here.

0:00:08.930,0:00:13.000
And then inside of it, we have a schools array, which we can see right here.

0:00:13.000,0:00:13.900
Key schools, and

0:00:13.900,0:00:17.870
then we know it's value is an array because of these square brackets.

0:00:17.870,0:00:21.360
Inside the schools array, we have two school objects.

0:00:21.360,0:00:25.330
And each one of which has a majors array, which we can see right here, and well,

0:00:25.330,0:00:27.520
as a few other key values.

0:00:27.520,0:00:30.220
After our schools, we have our online courses.

0:00:31.250,0:00:34.320
Online courses is an array of objects.

0:00:34.320,0:00:37.310
Here we have one online course, which is,

0:00:37.310,0:00:40.210
well, the one you're taking right now, JavaScript syntax.
