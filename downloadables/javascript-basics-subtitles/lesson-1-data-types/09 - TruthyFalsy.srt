So Cameron, why are we here?

0:00:03.460,0:00:06.660
>> I'm just checking out this soccer, I mean football scores.

0:00:06.660,0:00:08.450
>> And how does that relate to JavaScript?

0:00:08.450,0:00:09.660
>> You'll see.

0:00:09.660,0:00:11.500
Okay. So if I ask you whether or

0:00:11.500,0:00:14.630
not the US won any of these games, how you would respond?

0:00:14.630,0:00:17.200
Let's start with this first one against Ghana.

0:00:17.200,0:00:18.570
Did we win?

0:00:18.570,0:00:19.410
>> True.

0:00:19.410,0:00:20.750
>> Correct.

0:00:20.750,0:00:21.850
Okay.

0:00:21.850,0:00:23.470
What about this one, against Belgium?

0:00:24.490,0:00:25.720
>> Hm.

0:00:25.720,0:00:26.590
False.

0:00:26.590,0:00:27.700
>> Also correct.

0:00:27.700,0:00:29.060
All right. One last one.

0:00:29.060,0:00:33.403
What about that one, against Argentina?

0:00:33.403,0:00:33.903
>> Hm.

0:00:35.045,0:00:36.460
We didn't even play them.

0:00:36.460,0:00:37.650
>> correct.

0:00:37.650,0:00:40.518
And JavaScript gives us a way of expressing this, as Undefined.

0:00:43.132,0:00:43.694
>> Okay.

0:00:43.694,0:00:45.450
I see what you're getting at.

0:00:45.450,0:00:49.330
True and False isn't as cut and dry as our football chart.

0:00:49.330,0:00:52.270
JavaScript has a set of values that can evaluate to true or

0:00:52.270,0:00:55.150
false, but many not equal true or false.

0:00:55.150,0:00:59.500
Because of this, we call these values truthy and falsy.

0:00:59.500,0:01:04.000
Under truthy, we've got true, non-zero numbers,

0:01:05.180,0:01:11.540
strings with a length of at least one, objects, arrays, and functions.

0:01:12.730,0:01:17.662
And under falsy, we've got false, zero,

0:01:17.662,0:01:23.540
empty strings, undefined, null and Not a Number.

0:01:25.310,0:01:28.450
>> Undefined means that the variable doesn't exist and

0:01:28.450,0:01:30.280
the interpreter doesn't know what you're referring to.

0:01:31.710,0:01:36.460
Null means that the variable exist, but has well no value.

0:01:36.460,0:01:37.850
It's usually used as a placeholder.

0:01:39.020,0:01:43.430
And Not a Number is not a number or a result that isn't a number.

0:01:44.930,0:01:47.570
>> There's a link in the instructor's notes comparing Truthy and

0:01:47.570,0:01:50.500
Falsy values in Python and JavaScript.

0:01:50.500,0:01:52.600
Let's take a quiz to make sure you got them all.
