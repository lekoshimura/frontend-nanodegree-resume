So what else do we to tell the students, James?

0:00:08.590,0:00:10.460
>> Just how we'll be working in this course.

0:00:10.460,0:00:13.750
We'll be using two main tools, a text editor to code and

0:00:13.750,0:00:16.210
a browser to inspect our work.

0:00:16.210,0:00:19.930
All modern browsers include a powerful set of tools.

0:00:19.930,0:00:21.920
Commonly referred to as Developer Tools.

0:00:25.076,0:00:29.610
Which lets Developers inspect the way a website loads and runs.

0:00:29.610,0:00:32.590
Dev Tools also includes a console that allows you to

0:00:32.590,0:00:35.370
issue JavaScript commands against your website.

0:00:35.370,0:00:36.160
Let's give it a try.

0:00:36.160,0:00:37.200
>> Cool.

0:00:37.200,0:00:39.300
What do you have in mind?

0:00:39.300,0:00:42.490
>> Let's open up developer tools right now and run a command.

0:00:42.490,0:00:44.851
Let's say console.log();.

0:00:44.851,0:00:45.850
>> All right.

0:00:45.850,0:00:47.990
This sounds like a good time for a quiz.

0:00:47.990,0:00:50.720
Let's find out what console.log(); does.

0:00:50.720,0:00:56.620
I want you to pull up the console and type console.log("Hello world!");.

0:00:56.620,0:00:58.440
What happened when you ran the command?

0:00:58.440,0:00:59.060
Type it in here.
