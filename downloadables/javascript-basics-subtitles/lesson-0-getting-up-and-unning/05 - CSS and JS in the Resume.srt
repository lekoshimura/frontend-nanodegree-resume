CSS in this style.CSS file.

0:00:03.400,0:00:05.420
You wont be learning CSS in this class, but

CSS is pretty simple.

0:00:10.470,0:00:14.240
As we can see over here, it simply defining the styles of the page.

0:00:14.240,0:00:18.200
>> So what about this .jQuery file that you wanted to tell them about?

0:00:18.200,0:00:19.550
>> Yeah. jQuery.

0:00:19.550,0:00:20.600
It's a powerful and

0:00:20.600,0:00:23.580
popular JavaScript library that we'll be using in this class.

0:00:23.580,0:00:28.200
At a very high level, it lets us inspect and manipulate the elements in a page.

0:00:28.200,0:00:30.620
You won't be learning the ins and outs of jQuery in this class.

0:00:30.620,0:00:31.950
But, you'll get an idea of what you can do

0:00:31.950,0:00:34.630
with some very basic jQuery functions.

0:00:34.630,0:00:38.100
For more information about JQuery, check out the link in the instructor's notes.

0:00:38.100,0:00:41.060
>> The things we're doing with JQuery are fairly simple and

0:00:41.060,0:00:43.450
can be done Vanilla JavaScript as well,

0:00:43.450,0:00:47.570
just like we're doing in the script tag at the bottom of the HTML page.

0:00:47.570,0:00:51.770
But we wanted you to gain experience with using third-party libraries.

0:00:51.770,0:00:55.360
When appropriate, we will also list the Vanilla JavaScript ways to

0:00:55.360,0:00:57.150
do things in the instructor's notes.
