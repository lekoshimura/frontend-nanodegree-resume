It's cool that we learned how to use the console to manipulate other web pages,

0:00:04.059,0:00:05.630
but, of course, we need to start making our own.

0:00:06.660,0:00:07.920
>> It's easy to open up the page.

0:00:09.180,0:00:12.720
I'm going to get rid of this Hello World here.

0:00:12.720,0:00:17.590
And all you have to do is open index.html in the browser of your choice,

0:00:17.590,0:00:19.420
like we have here.

0:00:19.420,0:00:20.280
And refresh the page.

0:00:20.280,0:00:25.420
And you'll see a very exciting blank page.

0:00:25.420,0:00:27.690
Let's talk about how we're going to write something here on this page.

0:00:27.690,0:00:31.100
>> It's not too hard.

0:00:31.100,0:00:36.790
We can use jQuery's .append function to add HTML to an element on the page.

0:00:36.790,0:00:39.460
>> And if the element already has some HTML content,

0:00:40.470,0:00:44.550
a pen will add the new HTML to the end of the old content.

0:00:44.550,0:00:45.500
>> Yeah.

0:00:45.500,0:00:48.980
I have got ResumeBuilder.js open here.

0:00:48.980,0:00:52.940
For our website, we wanted to append HTML to the page's Header.

0:00:52.940,0:00:58.000
We will start with this jQuery selector for Header.

0:00:58.000,0:01:02.200
The pound sign tells us that we're looking for an element with the id of header.

0:01:02.200,0:01:06.240
So in our HTML, we see this div with id equals header.

0:01:06.240,0:01:08.180
This selector grabs this tag.

0:01:09.330,0:01:11.070
Let's give our students a chance to try it out.
