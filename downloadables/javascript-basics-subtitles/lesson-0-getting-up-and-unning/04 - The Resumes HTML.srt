0:00:05.363,0:00:08.330
>> Lets start with index.html.

0:00:08.330,0:00:10.760
Don't worry HTML is pretty simple.

0:00:10.760,0:00:13.868
It describes the content and lay out of elements on a web page.

0:00:15.250,0:00:19.250
We'll be comparing what we see here to the website.

0:00:19.250,0:00:22.980
In this top section, we see the page's head tag defined.

0:00:22.980,0:00:26.730
We'll often find CSS in JavaScript links, like these here.

0:00:28.380,0:00:32.490
Inside the body of the text, we can see that we've got content that says,

0:00:32.490,0:00:33.130
Hello world.

0:00:34.180,0:00:37.820
And when we flip over to Chrome, there it is.

0:00:39.290,0:00:41.212
If you want to learn more about HTML,

0:00:41.212,0:00:43.694
check out the link in the instructor's notes.

0:00:43.694,0:00:49.598
Looking through the HTML for our resume, there are a few elements worth noting.

0:00:49.598,0:00:53.280
Like this one, div id equals main.

0:00:53.280,0:00:56.810
I can see that it says, Hello world here, but showed up on the website.

0:00:57.820,0:01:00.340
Div represents different elements on the page,

0:01:00.340,0:01:03.860
you can think of them as starting like empty all purpose boxes.

0:01:03.860,0:01:07.890
In this case, we've given this div a unique id of main,

0:01:07.890,0:01:09.810
which our JavaScript will be referencing later.

0:01:10.860,0:01:12.840
Do you see anything else, James?

0:01:12.840,0:01:15.840
>> It doesn't look like a resume at all right now,

0:01:15.840,0:01:18.220
but I do see some structure for one.

0:01:18.220,0:01:22.530
It looks like there are sections for education, work and projects.

0:01:22.530,0:01:25.970
What do you think about filling these in with our resume data?

0:01:25.970,0:01:27.110
>> Yeah.

0:01:27.110,0:01:30.920
You know, web developers have options for building great web pages.

0:01:30.920,0:01:33.720
And I think there are two obvious strategies.

0:01:33.720,0:01:37.260
They can either hard code the information by writing HTML that

0:01:37.260,0:01:40.690
explicitly defines the content users should see.

0:01:40.690,0:01:42.530
Or they can use an HTML template and

0:01:42.530,0:01:46.340
fill it in with data programmatically when a user requests a page.

0:01:46.340,0:01:48.886
In this case, we can see the two work experience sections.

0:01:48.886,0:01:52.426
In the hard coded version, we can see all of Phillip J.

0:01:52.426,0:01:54.765
Fry's data listed here.

0:01:54.765,0:01:57.549
While on the template side, we see the work experience section.

0:01:57.549,0:01:58.940
But right now, it's empty.

0:02:00.170,0:02:03.900
>> The hard coded route is good to start, but it isn't a solution for

0:02:03.900,0:02:05.040
the long term.

0:02:05.040,0:02:07.120
Anytime we want to make a change to the page,

0:02:07.120,0:02:12.120
we have to open up the HTML, make the changes by hand, which can be a big pain.

0:02:12.120,0:02:15.960
For the resume project, we'll be using the template strategy.

0:02:15.960,0:02:17.440
What do you think?

0:02:17.440,0:02:18.700
>> Yeah, that works for me.

0:02:18.700,0:02:21.168
besides, if we weren't then this class would be about HTML.

0:02:21.168,0:02:23.890
Which it isn't.

0:02:23.890,0:02:27.670
>> Yeah, there are other great introductions to HTML online.

0:02:27.670,0:02:30.060
See the instructor's notes for a few links.

0:02:30.060,0:02:35.098
At the top of the HTML, there's a link to jQuery.js, the jQuery library.

0:02:35.098,0:02:38.320
There's also helper.js,

0:02:38.320,0:02:42.690
which contains some simple helper JavaScript we've prepared for your project.

0:02:42.690,0:02:45.300
We'll be coming back to it in a few minutes.

0:02:45.300,0:02:48.790
>> We've got two more script tags at the bottom of the HTML.

0:02:48.790,0:02:53.150
This tag for resumeBuilder.js, tells the browser to download and

0:02:53.150,0:02:55.030
execute some JavaScript.

0:02:55.030,0:02:59.760
We'll be using this script to add HTML content to the main section of the HTML.

0:02:59.760,0:03:03.430
>> The browser will render this page just saying, Hello world.

0:03:04.790,0:03:07.980
To give you a better overview of what's going on here,

0:03:07.980,0:03:11.340
we've zoomed out the page so you can see everything all at once.

0:03:11.340,0:03:16.700
We have Hello world here, some empty resume sections and then some JavaScript.

0:03:16.700,0:03:17.690
And over on this side,

0:03:17.690,0:03:21.770
we can see a general representation of how it would look in a browser.

0:03:21.770,0:03:23.823
We're printing the Hello world and

0:03:23.823,0:03:27.528
then after the Hello world, we have all of the resume sections.

0:03:27.528,0:03:31.713
And when we hit the JavaScript section that includes resume builder down here,

0:03:31.713,0:03:34.000
the browser will run the script.

0:03:34.000,0:03:38.350
Which will change the HTML in these experience sections and

0:03:38.350,0:03:40.590
the page will now show our resume.

0:03:40.590,0:03:41.780
>> But wait.

0:03:41.780,0:03:45.260
You may ask yourself, what about all of these experience sections.

0:03:45.260,0:03:46.570
It looks like they're in the resume, but

0:03:46.570,0:03:48.500
they aren't showing up on the page right now.

0:03:48.500,0:03:51.130
That's because of these scripts at the bottom of our resume.

0:03:51.130,0:03:54.070
Using JavaScript, we're checking to see if any of

0:03:54.070,0:03:56.250
these sections contain any content.

0:03:56.250,0:03:58.130
And if not, we hide them.

0:03:58.130,0:04:00.600
We'll get a chance to break down these JavaScript sections later
